### Hi there 👋

I am a first-year M.S. Atmospheric Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, I am studying the microphysical properties of winter mid-latitude cyclones. Past research topics have included occluded cyclones, lake-effect snow/lightning, and aviation meteorology.
